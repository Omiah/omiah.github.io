 Ever wonder what I do on my spare time? Well, I work... not a job type of work, it is more like poking at things and seeing what works and what does not. It is more like experimenting. Anyway, I am a college student and I am happily broke. That last part was just a joke. I have been trying to save up funds for some pretty cool projects that I have in mind, but there is no income coming to me. I know it is a shame, I have applied for a lot of jobs though. I am not talking like one or three. More like, 10 or 11. Anyway, I am trying to fund my projects. If you guys want to donate Bitcoins to me, that will help a lot! Thank you all!

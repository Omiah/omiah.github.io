The "real world", something I have been anticipating for what seems like an eternity is finally here. On May 31st I walk across a shanty wooden stage and receive my diploma. All is well though, I get to live with my mother for five more months to save a few bucks and then I am off to “enjoy” college life. I suppose it will be enjoyable. There will be less rules and more time for fun, so they say… fun, where can I find fun around here? It is very difficult to be amused by the amenities in this malnourished region of Florida. I wish I could take a road trip to San Francisco to meet developers and learn everything. That would be fun.

  I wonder how different life will really be though. I have yet to be contacted by any employer at all, but there is still hope, after all I have a whole life ahead of me with so much to do and so little time. Pretty soon I will get my college term schedule and also a work schedule, but I want to find a way to leave room for learning code and coding.

  I also am looking forward to doing a lot of integrated projects with my Raspberry Pi that I still have to program. All will come in time. The good news is that I know what I want to major in, Mechanical and Computer Engineering. I will be hired by Google one day, or create something better, something that probably does not exist. The Possibilities are endless.
